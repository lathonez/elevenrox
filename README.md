# README #

My old corp used Tenrox as a timesheeting utility. I found it so unusable (along with it's API), that I wrote this python program to expose a Javascript interface to Tenrox, so we could easily input time via various client-side tools (browser time tracking, etc). 

### What is this repository for? ###

* JSON RPC API for interacting with Tenrox
* Does not use standard Tenrox API, combination of HTTP scraping and XML, as such it is vulnerable if Tenrox make frontend code changes

### How do I get set up? ###

* TODO

### Testing ###

* TODO
